Insurance Management
</h1>

## Project Overview
The Insurance Management System is a comprehensive web-based application meticulously designed to streamline various insurance-related processes for an insurance company. It serves as a central platform that caters to multiple categories of insurances, encompassing Health Insurance, Vehicle Insurance, Life Insurance, and Property Insurance, among others. The system is specifically tailored to address the diverse needs of the insurance industry, focusing on enhancing operational efficiency, delivering exceptional customer service, and providing real-time access to critical insurance information for various stakeholders, including agents, underwriters, policy administrators, and policyholders.
This system is built using core Java, Spring Boot, Microservices architecture, Spring Framework, AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## In Scope Features:
1. **Policy Management:**
   - Create new insurance policies with unique policy numbers.
   - Retrieve policy details based on policy numbers or other criteria.
   - Update policy information such as coverage, contact details, and renewal dates.
   - Delete policies that are no longer valid or needed.

2. **Premium Calculation:**
   - Calculate premium amounts accurately based on policy details, coverage, and risk factors.
   - Provide real-time premium quotes for insurance agents and underwriters.

3. **User Authentication and Access Control:**
   - Implement secure user authentication with hashed passwords and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
   - Role-based access control for different user types, such as agents, administrators, and underwriters.

4. **Policy Search:**
   - Enable efficient search functionality to quickly find policies based on various criteria, such as policyholder name or date of purchase.

5. **Policy Integration:**
   - Integrate with external systems and third-party data sources for real-time data exchange and validation.

## Out of Scope Features:

- The system will not handle financial transactions or payment processing directly; it will provide premium quotes and reminders but not process actual transactions.
- The system will not include functionalities for financial accounting or invoicing.

## Technology Stack:
- **Core Java:** For backend development and business logic implementation.
- **Spring Boot:** To create microservices and provide a lightweight container for deployment.
- **Spring Framework:** Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) to manage components and dependencies.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Decoupled and independently deployable services for better scalability and maintainability.
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** Cloud platform for hosting the application and managing services.
- **Docker:** Containerization for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Kubernetes:** Container orchestration for automated deployment, scaling, and management.

## Microservices Components:
The Insurance Management System comprises the following microservices:

1. **Policy Service:**
   - Responsible for policy management operations (CRUD operations).
   - Stores policy data in a scalable and fault-tolerant database.

2. **Premium Service:**
   - Handles premium calculations based on policy details and risk factors.
   - Utilizes machine learning models for more accurate premium assessments.

3. **User Service:**
   - Manages user authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
   - Provides endpoints for user registration and profile management.

4. **Search Service:**
   - Implements efficient search algorithms to quickly retrieve policies based on various search criteria.


## Functional Requirements:
1. **Policy Creation:**
   - The Policy Service should allow insurance agents to create new insurance policies by providing policy details such as coverage, policyholder information, and premium amount. The system must generate a unique policy number for each new policy.

2. **Policy Retrieval:**
   - The Policy Service should provide APIs to retrieve policy information based on policy numbers or other search criteria.

3. **Policy Updates:**
   - Authorized users, such as administrators, should be able to update policy details, including coverage changes, contact information, and renewal dates.

4. **Policy Deletion:**
   - The system should allow administrators to delete policies that are no longer valid or needed.

5. **Premium Calculation:**
   - The Premium Service must accurately calculate premium amounts based on policy details, coverage, and risk factors.

6. **User Authentication:**
   - The User Service should implement a secure user authentication mechanism with hashed passwords and JWT tokens. The system must verify user credentials during login.

7. **Role-based Access Control:**
   - The User Service should support role-based access control, granting different permissions to agents, administrators, and underwriters.

8. **Policy Search:**
   - The Search Service should provide APIs for efficient policy search based on various criteria, such as policyholder name, policy type, or date of purchase.

## Non-Functional Requirements:
1. **Performance:**
   - The Insurance Management System is designed for high performance and scalability. With Kubernetes, the system can dynamically scale the microservices based on demand to handle increasing workloads.

2. **Scalability:**
   - The application ensures security through HTTPS, secure login mechanisms, and role-based access control. Sensitive data is encrypted and stored securely in the AWS cloud.

3. **Security:**
   - Data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information.
   - User authentication and access control must be implemented securely to prevent unauthorized access.

4. **Availability:**
   - The application should aim for high availability, with minimal downtime and quick recovery in case of failures.

5. **Reliability:**
   - The microservices should be reliable, robust, and able to handle errors gracefully.

6. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to track system performance and detect anomalies.

7. **Containerization:**
   - The application must be containerized using Docker to ensure consistent deployment across different environments.

8. **Orchestration:**
   - Kubernetes should be used for container orchestration, providing automated deployment, scaling, and management of microservices.

9. **Cloud-Native:**
   - The application should take full advantage of cloud-native features offered by AWS to optimize performance and cost.
